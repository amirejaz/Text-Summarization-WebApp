# Text-Summarization-WebApp
This is a simple Flask web application for text summarization. The app allows users to enter a piece of text, and it generates a summary of the input text using an extractive text summarization technique.
              
## Features              
- Users can enter any text in the provided input form.             
- The app uses spaCy's natural language processing library to tokenize and analyze the input text.          
- Stop words and punctuations are removed from the text to focus on meaningful content.        
- Word frequencies are calculated to identify key content.        
- Sentences are scored based on word frequencies, and a summary is generated by selecting the top-scoring sentences.       
- The final summary is displayed on the summary page.                        
## Technologies Used                                      
- Python             
- Flask web framework             
- spaCy NLP library          
## Installation and Setup           
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amirejaz/text-summarization-app.git          
- Change to the project directory: cd text-summarization-app             
## Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt           
- Run the Flask app: python app.py                              
- Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the app.            
## Usage                    
- Enter the text you want to summarize in the input form on the home page.              
- Click the "Submit" button to generate the summary.                                
- The app will redirect you to the summary page, where you can see the generated summary.                 
## About the Implementation                            
The app uses a simple extractive text summarization approach to identify important sentences in the input text. The sentences with the highest word frequencies are selected as part of the summary. The summarization algorithm leverages the spaCy library for natural language processing.

Feel free to contribute to the project by adding more summarization techniques, improving the user interface, or implementing other features related to text processing and analysis.
